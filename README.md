###  :mag_right: On today's react adventure: Making a responsive navbar :mag:

Building a responsive navbar from scratch. I used scss and @reach-router instead of react-router, the router packages are very similar.

[thanks to this youtuber for teaching us the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97A3uRS7_YA).It is 46 minutes, but there aren't many tutorials using functional components, so here you go. No fancy hooks besides useState and mainly SCSS based.
Great to learn!

I will be customizing this soon. preview image will come when i do so.
